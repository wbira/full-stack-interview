<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Design Pattern is a typical solution to commonly occurring problem in software design. You could compare DP to a blueprint that can be taken and customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

### 2. Why we should use design patterns?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

The most important reason is that patterns simplify the design and support of programs.

- Tried and tested solutions.
- Code unification - you create fewer bugs, since you use typical unified solutions where all hidden bugs have already been discovered.
- Universal programmers’ vocabulary - instead of explaining some problem you can use pattern name that will be enough for another developer to understand the problem.

### 3. What are the main categories of design patterns?

### 11. What is _Bridge_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Structural design pattern that lets you split a giant class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies, abstraction and implementation, which can be developed independently of each other.

</details>

### 12. What is _Composite_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

### 15. What is _Flyweight_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
