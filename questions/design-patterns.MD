_Note: Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would._

### 1. Explain what is a pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Design Pattern is a typical solution to commonly occurring problem in software design. You could compare DP to a blueprint that can be taken and customized to solve a particular design problem in your code.

</details>

### 2. Why we should use design patterns?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

The most important reason is that patterns simplify the design and support of programs.

- Tried and tested solutions.
- Code unification - you create fewer bugs, since you use typical unified solutions where all hidden bugs have already been discovered.
- Universal programmersâ€™ vocabulary - instead of explaining some problem you can use pattern name that will be enough for another developer to understand the problem.

### 3. What are the main categories of design patterns?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

- Creational: all about creating new objects.
- Structural: structuring your classes effectively, making the relationships minimal etc.

### 8. What is _Object pool_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>
    
Special kind of factory, which main purpose is reusing/sharing objects, that creations is hard (e.g time consuming).
Client of object poll requests object, do some operation on it. After it finish it returns object to pool instead of destroy it.
Good example of implementation Object Pool pattern is [Thread pool from .NET Framework.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.threadpool?view=netframework-4.7.2)

</details>

### 9. What is _Prototype_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Creating new objects by coping existing ones without compromising their internals.

</details>

### 10. What is _Adapter_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Adapter is a special object that converts calls sent by one object to the format that another object can understand. Adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.

</details>

### 11. What is _Bridge_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Structural design pattern that lets you split a giant class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies, abstraction and implementation, which can be developed independently of each other.

</details>

### 12. What is _Composite_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Composing objects into tree structures and allowing clients to work with them as if they were individual objects.

### 13. What is _Decorator_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

### 14. What is _Facade_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

The facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem containing dozens of classes. The facade may have limited functionality in comparison to working with subsystem directly. It includes only those features that clients care about.

</details>

### 15. What is _Flyweight_ pattern?

<details>
    <summary>
        Answer
    </summary>

Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of object state among multiple objects, instead of keeping it in each object.
